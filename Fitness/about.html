                    <h1>Common Exerciezes</h1>
                    <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their dialy exercise routine.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Burpee</dt>
                        <dd>Burpees are a great, fully body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>

                        <dt>Plank</dt>
                        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor, and hold that position for however long you can in intervals; 30 seconds to 1 minute.</dd>

                        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a pushup position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
